summary:   Fight back the plague of the Queen Verminia!
description: |
  A ferocious insect army from planet Verminest is spreading through the space. Defend your planet and fight back them until you finally reach the nest of Queen Verminia. They came from Verminest is 100% oldschool, based in early arcades like Galaga or Centipede, but also in Sci-Fi movies from the 50's like Them!, The Deadly Mantis, Black Scorpion, Tarantula or my favourite: Godzilla! Crazy maneuvers are rewarded: kill enemies in a short-range to get medals, kill leaders to scare enemies an get more medals. You'll get a bonus every 10 medals! Clever gameplay, grayscale color palette, FM music fanfares and sound effects will take you back to the never-existent Arcade era of the 50's, where fun was the only thing!
